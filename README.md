# Human-Resources-Department-Solution
Overview
This project is designed to address critical challenges faced by Human Resources (HR) departments in hiring and retaining employees efficiently. By leveraging data science techniques, this project aims to predict which employees are more likely to quit. This predictive model assists HR in making informed decisions, ultimately saving time and reducing costs associated with employee turnover.

Project Structure
Human_Resources_Department_Solution.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all data analyses, model building, and evaluations.
data/: This directory contains datasets used for model training and testing.
requirements.txt: A text file listing the libraries required to run the project.
Features
Data Exploration: Analyze employee data to understand factors influencing employee turnover.
Model Building: Implements several machine learning algorithms including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Artificial Neural Networks
Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to evaluate model performance.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.8 or above). You will also need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the .ipynb file
